# Distro tests for ddlc-themes: run install.sh for real, as root, inside a container of
# an actual distribution — the one thing the stub-based suite cannot do. Asserts the
# whole contract: the preflight refuses and its printed guidance actually works, the
# install lands every component, selective uninstall keeps the rest, --uninstall takes
# everything back out.
#
#   tests/distro.sh              every distribution below
#   tests/distro.sh debian       just one
#
# Needs docker or podman. In CI this runs on push to master, weekly, and by hand — never
# on pull requests: a flaky mirror must not redden someone's change. Images are :latest
# on purpose — the weekly run is the upstream-drift detector, so no assertion may depend
# on what an image happens to carry already.
#
# From the huix-standard template, adapted: this installer projects onto a config tree
# (~/.config and ~/.claude), not a prefix, so the PREFIX asserts become config-home ones
